# Passwordgenerator
Purpose of the project:
The application should generate a password based on the following criteria:
1. Length (must be between 8 and 128 characters)


2. Character type:


    Special characters (!#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~")


    Numeric characters (0-9)


    Lowercase characters (abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz)


    Uppercase characters (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ)


Brainstorming:

Given a random password length -> need one var that generates a random number (length of characters) between 8 to 128

Password needs to include all type of characters -> need one var that store all the characters mentioned above

The application needs to be able to generate random password based on random length (between 8 to 128) and random characters -> run charAt on the var that store all the charactors randomly in a loop based on the random lenghth generated)

Execution
When user clicks on Generate button on HTML

Length of the password is generated in Javascipt

The loop will run @ the length of the password and generate character randomly from the available character type

A random password with random length will be generated

User can copy the new password by clicking on the Copy button

User can paste the new password to another application to use.
